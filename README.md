# CloudComputing-AutoDeployment
Using deployment manager to deploy a IaaS/PaaS application for the cloud computing module. This can be further adapted.
This repository hosts the code that I have created for my cloud computing module at the University of Lincoln. This has been created using the Google cloud deployment manager.

I am learning Azure in my own time and will be creating this in said providers technology shortly.
